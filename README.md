# deeplib
A deep learning library built from scratch using numpy and numba [work in progress]. 

# Motivation
The point is to understand better how deep learning models and frameworks work under the hood by building a small deep learning library from first principles.  
This library is not made to replace deep learning frameworks in any way, but nonetheless I would like to make it not too bad computationaly speaking (hence the use of numba).
